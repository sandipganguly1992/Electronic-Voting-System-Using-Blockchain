# Electronic-Voting-System-Using-Blockchain

# Problem Statement
To ensure a smooth, fair, and democratic election process through the implementation of blockchain technology in electronic voting machines by completely eradicating illegal voting, strengthening the data protection, and more accurate verification of the polling outcomes. Whether talking about traditional paper-based voting, voting via digital voting machines, or an online voting system, several conditions need to be satisfied: 
•	Eligibility: Only legitimate voters should be able to take part in voting
•	Unreusability: Each voter can vote only once
•	Privacy: No one except the voter can obtain information about the voter’s choice
•	Fairness: No one can obtain intermediate voting results
•	Soundness: Invalid ballots should be detected and not taken into account during tallying
•	Completeness: All valid ballots should be tallied correctly

# Code Explanation
•	Through our code, we aim to connect the 3 nodes (terminals) first.
•	Then the user performs a transaction or casts a vote, wherein a block is mined and a transaction is added to it.
•	The same transaction process can also be performed separately.
•	Post adding the transaction, the message is broadcasted across several blocks and the chain is updated accordingly.
•	At last, the admin can count all the votes using the get chain functionality.

# Advantages and Challenges
•	The full implementation of the system would improve the existing election process in areas of vote rigging, evm hacks / failures, save costs of conducting election process, improve privacy of user votes and database of the transactions collected.
•	Database of eligible voters can only enable eligible persons to login and vote.
•	Recorded transaction of a user will not allow them to vote again.
•	Recorded transaction of users can be used to count votes, in total and for particular category.
•	Still, it would cost millions to implement a nascent technology which involves millions of voters plus the cost of maintenance.
•	Energy management would be an issue in India to maintain such a technology.
•	Digital penetration in India is very low among adults.
